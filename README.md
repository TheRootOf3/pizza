# Andrzej's Margheritas website

Yes, it's *exactly* what you think! I finally created a website to track all the pizza spots I've been to! üçï

I also used it as a perfect opportunity to learn more about using AI dev tools. Hence, this website has been built mostly using [aider](https://aider.chat) + Claude 3.5 Sonnet/Haiku, with additional changes made with GitHub Copilot running gpt-4o.
